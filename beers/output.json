It produces a fine head of froth and preserves the beer’s aromas to the full.", "character_tastes_aromas": "Aromas of red fruits, malt and hop are followed by a taste that will surprise you, with touches of roasted malt and impressions of aniseed, liquorice and hops.", "culinary": "This Belgian \"Dubbel\" goes with almost any hard cheese and/or Belgian Blue cheeses like an \"Achelse Blauwe\".", "keeping_storage": "The recommended storage time is 12 months in the bottle and 6 months on tap (in kegs)."},

In common with the Achel 8 Bruin, the main fermentation is done with a yeast supplied by the Van Steenberghe brewery.

The simplest, and most basic of tulip-shaped glasses, it is a perfect alternative for the classic, sober Achel chalice. Both Achel glasses can be purchased from quality drinks stores and beer shops. They are also easy to track down online.", "character_tastes_aromas": "This is beer with an honest, sweet, malty palate, somewhat reminiscent of bread, which is complemented by the fruity-sweet touches of young pear and banana. Low on body, It is a tender thirst quencher, with just a wisp of bitter in the finish, one that leaves the palate with a decided gentleness.", "culinary": "This beautiful tripel is a perfect companion for a '", "keeping_storage": "Can be kept for at least two years. After that period, the taste may evolve negatively. In particular the hoppy character of this beer will diminish over time.

It also goes very well with a steak-and-fries combo.", "keeping_storage": "Adriaen Brouwer keeps for around 10 months in the bottle, and up to 7 months on tap. Taking into account its lower alcohol content, and its general character, there's no point in keeping this beer for any longer than the brewer advises."},

Its taste betrays touches of caramel, biscuits, cakes and cookies. The malty palate is freshened up by a beautiful pearlisation, and it all culminates in a well-rounded bitterness.", "culinary": "Achel 8 Bruin is a great companion for rabbit stew with mashed potato and/or pumpkin. Also a fantastic pairing with dark Belgian chocolate. In the kitchen, this beer works well for the preparation of a number of dark sauces, or for use in stews – ‘Vlaamse Karbonaden’, for example, or pork chops the Flemish way.", "keeping_storage": "Best stored in a cool and dark room. The taste will evolve after two years and oxidation may occur. So this is not a beer to keep much longer than two years."},
